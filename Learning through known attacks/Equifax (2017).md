### Teaching Threat Hunting for Equifax Breach-Like Attacks (2017): A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter with expertise in web application exploits and large-scale PII theft, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2017 Equifax data breach. This was a state-sponsored operation (suspected Chinese hackers, per U.S. intelligence and Mandiant analysis), exploiting an unpatched vulnerability in Apache Struts (CVE-2017-5638, a remote code execution flaw in the web app framework) on Equifax's U.S. consumer dispute portal. Attackers gained initial access in May 2017, enumerated back-end systems, dumped ~147.9 million consumer records (names, SSNs, DOBs, addresses, driver's licenses, credit card numbers for 209K), and exfiltrated data over ~2 months. No ransomware; focus was on identity theft enablers. An expired web app security certificate further aided evasion by blocking scans.

Dwell time: ~76 days (May 13-July 30, 2017), undetected due to unpatched Struts (despite March 2017 patch), poor segmentation (web app to DB), no SIEM for app logs, and ignored alerts. Detection: July 29, 2017, via suspicious traffic by security team; full scope revealed in September 2017. Impacts: $1.4B FTC settlement (2019), CEO Richard Smith's resignation, 40 class actions consolidated, free credit monitoring for victims, and accelerated U.S. regulations (e.g., CCPA influences). From a MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise perspective, key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Exploit Public-Facing Application T1190), TA0002 (Execution: Exploitation for Client Execution T1203), TA0008 (Lateral Movement: Valid Accounts T1078.002), TA0005 (Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses T1562.001), TA0007 (Discovery: Account Discovery T1087), TA0006 (Credential Access: OS Credential Dumping T1003), TA0009 (Collection: Data from Information Repositories T1213), and TA0010 (Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service T1567.002).

Threat hunting assumes exploit: Hypothesis-driven searches for web app vulns leading to DB theft in financial/consumer firms. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: Web-facing apps (e.g., Struts on Tomcat), connected DBs (SQL Server); high-volume PII.
- **Adversary Profile**: State-sponsored (zero-day exploits, low-noise exfil; identity fraud goals).
- **Challenges**: Legacy unpatched apps, massive data masking exfil, certificate gaps.
- **Tools/Data Sources**: WAF logs (ModSecurity), EDR (Defender for endpoints), SIEM (Splunk for app/DB logs), vuln scanners (Nessus), YARA/Sigma for Struts IOCs (e.g., SHA256: 4e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f).
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., "An adversary has exploited web vulns to dump PII from DBs."

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (mapped from ReliaQuest's MITRE analysis, House Oversight report, and Mandiant). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data collection, analysis, pivoting. Includes realistic queries, Sigma rules, and expert tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., app sims) to avoid PCI-DSS issues. Baselines: 30-60 days of web/DB logs for anomalies.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Contextualize the breachâ€”Equifax's unpatched Struts enabled DB access; prioritize app scanning.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK for T1190 (e.g., Struts exploits). IOCs: CVE-2017-5638 payloads (e.g., Content-Type header exploits), DB dumps (SQL injection patterns). Cross-ref ReliaQuest MITRE mapping, Breachsense case study, Wikipedia, and Equifax disclosure.
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory web apps (Struts/Tomcat), DBs (SQL connections). Use Nessus for CVE scans; BloodHound for app-to-DB paths.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log app requests (no exploits), DB queries (no dumps). Tool: Sysmon (app config for process/network); WAF for headers.
- **Expert Tip**: Renew certs quarterly. Hypothesis: "State actors exploit web vulns for PII; hunt anomalous app traffic leading to DB queries."

#### Step 2: Hunt for Initial Access (TA0001) - Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)
