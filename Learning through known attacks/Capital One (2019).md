### Teaching Threat Hunting for Capital One Breach-Like Attacks (2019): A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter with expertise in cloud misconfigurations and SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) exploits, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2019 Capital One data breach. This incident was perpetrated by Paige Thompson, a former AWS engineer (arrested July 29, 2019; pleaded guilty in 2022, sentenced to time served plus probation). Thompson exploited a misconfigured web application firewall (WAF) in Capital One's AWS environment, using an SSRF vulnerability in a customer dispute portal to access metadata services and assume an IAM role. This allowed her to enumerate S3 buckets and exfiltrate ~100 million customer records (106M total: names, addresses, DOBs, emails, phone numbers, SSNs for 14M, credit scores, balances, and 80K+ credit card apps with partial numbers). The attack was reconnaissance-heavy, with Thompson scanning ~30 organizations (e.g., government entities). No malware; it was a pure misconfig exploit.

Dwell time: ~2 months (March 2019 scanning to July 2019 access/exfil; discovered July 2019 via internal alert). Undetected due to over-privileged IAM roles, no WAF logging for SSRF, and unmonitored metadata access. Detection: AWS CloudTrail anomaly (unusual IAM role assumption); Thompson's GitHub posts (e.g., "marvelous" repo with scan code) aided attribution. Impacts: $190M settlement (2021, including $80M class-action), $80M FTC fine (2022), CEO resignation, and enhanced AWS IAM best practices. From a MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise perspective, key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Exploitation of Public-Facing Application T1190 via SSRF), TA0002 (Execution: Exploitation for Client Execution T1203), TA0005 (Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses T1562.001 via misconfig), TA0007 (Discovery: Cloud Service Discovery T1526), TA0006 (Credential Access: Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates T1606.002 via IAM), TA0009 (Collection: Data from Cloud Storage T1530), and TA0010 (Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service T1567.002).

Threat hunting assumes misconfig: Hypothesis-driven searches for SSRF and IAM abuse in cloud environments. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, WAF); web apps with metadata access.
- **Adversary Profile**: Insider/former employee (recon tools, IAM role chaining; data theft for fraud/espionage).
- **Challenges**: CloudTrail volume, over-priv IAM, SSRF bypasses WAF.
- **Tools/Data Sources**: CloudTrail (API logs), GuardDuty (anomalies), SIEM (Splunk for IAM), IAM Access Analyzer, YARA/Sigma for SSRF IOCs (e.g., unusual metadata fetches).
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., "An adversary exploits SSRF to assume IAM roles and dump S3 data."

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (mapped from Exabeam MITRE analysis and ACM case study). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data collection, analysis, pivoting. Includes realistic queries, Sigma rules, and expert tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., AWS sandboxes) to avoid compliance (e.g., PCI). Baselines: 30-60 days of CloudTrail for anomalies.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Contextualize the breachâ€”Thompson's SSRF chained to IAM over-priv; prioritize metadata monitoring.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK for T1190 (SSRF). IOCs: SSRF payloads (e.g., gopher://metadata), IAM role assumptions (e.g., CapitalOne-AWSRole). Cross-ref Exabeam MITRE mapping, ACM systematic analysis, Capital One facts, and Medium breakdown.
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory web apps (WAF configs), IAM roles (e.g., over-priv for S3), metadata endpoints. Use IAM Access Analyzer for privs; GuardDuty for SSRF.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log IAM assumptions (internal), metadata fetches (none from apps). Tool: Sysmon (cloud config for API); CloudTrail for events.
- **Expert Tip**: Least-priv IAM. Hypothesis: "Ex-dev exploits SSRF to chain IAM roles; hunt anomalous metadata access leading to S3 dumps."

#### Step 2: Hunt for Initial Access (TA0001) - Exploitation of Public-Facing Application (T1190 via SSRF)
