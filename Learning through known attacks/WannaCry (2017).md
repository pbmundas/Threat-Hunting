### Teaching Threat Hunting for WannaCry Ransomware Attack-Like Attacks (2017): A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter with extensive experience in ransomware worm variants and rapid-propagation threats, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2017 WannaCry ransomware outbreak. This was a global cyber event attributed to North Korea's Lazarus Group (per U.S. government attribution in 2018), deploying ransomware that exploited the EternalBlue vulnerability (CVE-2017-0144/5, an SMBv1 remote code execution flaw leaked from the NSA by Shadow Brokers). Starting on May 12, 2017, at 07:44 UTC, WannaCry spread as a self-propagating worm, infecting over 200,000 computers in 150 countries within days. It encrypted files (appending .WCRY) and demanded $300-600 in Bitcoin, but was halted at 15:03 UTC by researcher Marcus Hutchins registering a kill switch domain. The malware targeted Windows systems, using EternalBlue for lateral movement, Mimikatz for credential dumping, and a wiper component for destruction. While disguised as ransomware, it was largely destructive, with unrecoverable keys in many cases.

Dwell time: Very short per victim (~hours to days for spread and encryption), but preparation involved months (Shadow Brokers leak in April 2017; North Korean development earlier). Undetected due to unpatched SMBv1 (despite MS17-010 patch in March 2017), no network segmentation, and rapid worm behavior overwhelming defenses. Detection: Initial alerts from AV firms (e.g., Kaspersky on May 12); global response by Microsoft (emergency patches for XP) and Hutchins' sinkhole. Impacts: $4 billion+ in global losses (e.g., NHS hospitals disrupted, Renault factories halted), accelerated patching (e.g., end of XP support reconsidered), and geopolitical tensions (U.S. sanctions on North Korea). From a MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise/ICS perspective (from MITRE S0366), key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Exploit Public-Facing Application T1190 via EternalBlue), TA0002 (Execution: Exploitation for Client Execution T1203), TA0003 (Persistence: Valid Accounts T1078.002), TA0005 (Defense Evasion: File and Directory Permissions Modification T1222.001), TA0006 (Credential Access: OS Credential Dumping T1003), TA0007 (Discovery: Remote System Discovery T1018), TA0008 (Lateral Movement: Exploitation of Remote Services T1210), TA0009 (Collection: File and Directory Discovery T1083), TA0010 (Exfiltration: Encrypted Channel T1573.002), and TA0040 (Impact: Data Encrypted for Impact T1486, Inhibit System Recovery T1490).

Threat hunting assumes infection: Hypothesis-driven searches for SMB exploits leading to worm-like ransomware in healthcare/manufacturing. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: Windows-heavy nets (SMBv1 enabled, unpatched MS17-010), OT/IT convergence (e.g., factories/hospitals).
- **Adversary Profile**: State-sponsored (worm via exploits, destruction over profit; geopolitical motives).
- **Challenges**: Rapid spread overwhelms, unpatched legacy (XP/7), limited OT logging.
- **Tools/Data Sources**: EDR (Microsoft Defender for SMB), SIEM (Splunk for network/DB), vuln scanners (Nessus for CVE-2017-0144), YARA/Sigma for WannaCry IOCs (e.g., SHA256: 65cee234f3ce2e3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b).
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., "An adversary exploits SMBv1 to propagate ransomware across segments."

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (from MITRE S0366 and reports). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data sources, hunting steps (queries, Sigma, etc.), tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., Windows labs) to avoid spread. Baselines: 30-60 days of SMB/network logs for anomalies.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Context is keyâ€”WannaCry's worm spread via EternalBlue; focus on SMB patching.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK for S0366 (e.g., T1210 for EternalBlue). IOCs: Ransomware notes ("$300 BTC"), wiper binaries, C2 (Tor for ransom). Cross-ref MITRE S0366, Wikipedia, CISA alert, and Cloudflare summary.
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory Windows hosts (SMBv1 enabled), OT (e.g., Modbus-linked). Use Nmap for vuln ports (445); BloodHound for spread paths.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log SMB connects (no exploits), encryption (none). Tool: Sysmon (SMB config for network/process); Wireshark for dissectors.
- **Expert Tip**: SMBv1 disablement. Hypothesis: "Lazarus exploits EternalBlue for worm spread; hunt SMB anomalies leading to encryption."
