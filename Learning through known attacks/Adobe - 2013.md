### Teaching Threat Hunting for Adobe Breach-Like Attacks (2013): A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter with deep experience in enterprise software supply-chain compromises and large-scale data exfiltration incidents, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2013 Adobe breach. This was a sophisticated cybercrime operation (no specific attribution, but likely Eastern European or state-linked actors based on forum dumps), targeting Adobe's customer database and intellectual property. Attackers exploited an unpatched vulnerability in Adobe's ColdFusion server (CVE-2013-3331, a remote code execution flaw in the web application framework) to gain initial access, then pivoted to dump ~153 million user records (initially reported as 38M, later expanded via HIBP analysis). Stolen data included internal IDs, usernames, emails, encrypted (unsalted 3DES) passwords, plaintext password hints, and ~2.9M credit card details. Additionally, ~40GB of source code for products like Acrobat, Reader, ColdFusion, and Photoshop was exfiltrated, enabling potential backdooring or reverse engineering.

The dwell time was ~2 months (mid-August to early October 2013), with detection via an external security researcher (Brian Krebs) spotting a 3.8GB dump on a Russian forum, prompting Adobe's internal confirmation. Impacts: $1M+ settlement from class-action lawsuits, eroded customer trust, widespread credential stuffing (e.g., cracked passwords led to ATOs), and long-term IP risks (e.g., poisoned updates). From a MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise perspective, key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Exploit Public-Facing Application T1190), TA0002 (Execution: Exploitation for Client Execution T1203), TA0003 (Persistence: Create or Modify System Process T1543), TA0008 (Lateral Movement: Exploitation of Remote Services T1210), TA0009 (Collection: Data from Information Repositories T1213), TA0010 (Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service T1567.002), and TA0005 (Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses T1562.001 via weak encryption).

Threat hunting assumes breach: Hypothesis-driven searches for web app exploits leading to DB/IP theft in software firms. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: Hybrid cloud/on-prem (e.g., ColdFusion on IIS/Apache, SQL Server/Oracle DBs, dev repos like Git); high-value targets (customer DBs, source code vaults).
- **Adversary Profile**: Cybercriminals (opportunistic RCE, bulk dumps for dark web sales; low noise, focus on monetization).
- **Challenges**: Unpatched legacy apps (ColdFusion EOL risks), weak crypto (unsalted 3DES crackable offline), massive data volumes masking exfil.
- **Tools/Data Sources**: SIEM (Splunk/ELK for web/DB logs), WAF (ModSecurity), EDR (Microsoft Defender), cloud trails (Azure/AWS), vuln scanners (Nessus), YARA/Sigma for IOCs (e.g., ColdFusion exploits).
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., "An adversary has exploited a web app vuln to access DBs and exfil source code."

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (inferred from Krebs reports, Adobe disclosures, and HIBP). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data collection, analysis, pivoting. Includes realistic queries, Sigma rules, and expert tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., staging servers) to avoid prod impact. Baselines: 30-60 days of web/DB logs for anomaly detection.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Contextualize the breachâ€”Adobe's unpatched ColdFusion enabled RCE, leading to DB pivots.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK for T1190 (e.g., ColdFusion exploits). IOCs: CVE-2013-3331 payloads (e.g., JSP webshells like "cfinclude.jsp"), dump patterns (e.g., forum posts with Adobe hashes), source code archives (e.g., ph1.tar.gz from Krebs). Cross-ref Krebs on Security , HIBP , BBC , and Adobe's 2013 blog.
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory public-facing apps (e.g., ColdFusion instances), DB schemas (user tables with creds), IP repos (e.g., SVN/Git). Use tools like Shodan for exposed ports (8500 for ColdFusion) or AWS Config for asset lists.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log web requests (e.g., anomalous POSTs to /CFIDE/admin), DB queries (SELECT on users), outbound traffic (large ZIP/TAR). Tool: Enable IIS advanced logging; Sysmon for server processes.
- **Expert Tip**: Scan for legacy ColdFusion (v9/10 vulnerable); hypothesis: "Attackers target unpatched web apps for RCE; hunt exploit attempts on admin endpoints."

#### Step 2: Hunt for Initial Access (TA0001) - Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)
Entry via CVE-2013-3331 in ColdFusion, allowing unauth RCE (e.g., uploading JSP shells).
- **Hypothesis**: "An adversary has exploited a web app vuln to upload shells or execute code."
- **Data Sources**: WAF/IIS logs (e.g., 404s on /CFIDE/), error logs (CFIDE exceptions), network metadata (Zeek for port 8500 probes).
- **Step-by-Step Hunting**:
  1. Query Exploit Attempts: Splunk SPL: `index=web sourcetype=iis | search uri_path="/CFIDE/admin/*" OR payload="*cfexecute*" | stats count by client_ip, user_agent | where count > 5`.
  2. Sigma Rule (YAML):
     ```
     title: ColdFusion RCE Exploit (CVE-2013-3331)
     logsource:
       category: web
     detection:
       selection:
         request_uri: '/CFIDE/administrator/*'
         method: 'POST'
         body: '*<cfexecute*' OR '*jsp shell*'
       condition: selection
     ```
     Deploy in SIEM; alert on anomalous POSTs from non-US IPs (Adobe breach had Eastern European ties).
  3. Analyze Payloads: Grep access logs for JSP uploads (e.g., "cfinclude.jsp" or base64 shells); use Burp Suite for replay testing.
  4. Pivoting: If hits, check for successful 200 OK on shell endpoints; trace to DB connects.
- **Expert Tip**: Patch ColdFusion; use ASLR/DEP. Realistic: 2013 exploits were public; hunt for scanner traffic (e.g., Nessus signatures).

#### Step 3: Hunt for Execution (TA0002) - Exploitation for Client/Server Execution (T1203/T1499)
