### Teaching Threat Hunting for CCleaner Supply Chain Attack-Like Attacks (2017): A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter with expertise in supply chain compromises and software update threats, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2017 CCleaner supply chain attack. This incident was a sophisticated supply chain compromise attributed to the Chinese state-sponsored APT group Axiom (also known as APT17, DeputyDog, or Winnti, linked to PLA Unit 61398), targeting Piriform (CCleaner developer, acquired by Avast in July 2017). Attackers breached Piriform's build servers in March 2017 via RDP and malware, injecting backdoors into CCleaner versions 5.33.8162/8631 (32/64-bit), distributed via official updates from August 15 to September 15, 2017. The initial stage (infecting 2.27M users) used a loader to download a second-stage backdoor (ShadowPad variant) from C2 servers, targeting ~700K systems. A third stage (keylogger module, ShadowPad customized) was deployed to only 20 specific high-value targets (e.g., Akamai, Sony, Microsoft, HTC, Linksys domains), stealing data for espionage. No ransomware; focus on IP theft.

Dwell time: ~6 months (March 2017 breach to September 2017 detection by Cisco Talos/Morphisec, who analyzed the backdoor and notified Avast/FBI). Undetected due to signed malicious binaries evading AV, no build process monitoring, and targeted second-stage (only activated on specific IPs). Detection: Talos reverse-engineered the loader, revealing C2; Avast/FBI shut down infrastructure. Impacts: 2.27M infections (potential botnet), targeted espionage on tech firms, $1M+ Avast remediation, heightened supply chain scrutiny (e.g., SolarWinds precursor), and attribution to Axiom via code reuse (e.g., base64 variants from Operation Aurora 2009). From a MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise perspective, key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Valid Accounts T1078.002 via RDP), TA0002 (Execution: User Execution T1204.002 via updates), TA0003 (Persistence: Create Account T1136 on servers), TA0005 (Defense Evasion: Obfuscated Files T1027), TA0007 (Discovery: Software Discovery T1518), TA0008 (Lateral Movement: Remote Services T1021.001), TA0009 (Collection: Data from Information Repositories T1213), TA0010 (Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service T1567.002), and TA0004 (Privilege Escalation: Access Token Manipulation T1134).

Threat hunting assumes compromise: Hypothesis-driven searches for build server breaches leading to tainted updates in software vendors. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: DevOps pipelines (e.g., build servers, GitHub, update mirrors); high-trust updates (signed binaries).
- **Adversary Profile**: State-sponsored (RDP for foothold, modular backdoors like ShadowPad; targeted espionage on tech).
- **Challenges**: Signed malware evades detection, supply chain trust, second-stage geo-fencing.
- **Tools/Data Sources**: EDR (CrowdStrike for endpoints), SIEM (Splunk for build logs), code scanners (TruffleHog), YARA/Sigma for ShadowPad IOCs (e.g., SHA256: 6f7840c77f99049d788155c1351e1560b62b8ad18ad0e9adda8218b9f432f0a9 for loader).
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., "An adversary has breached build servers to inject backdoors into updates."

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (mapped from Cisco Talos, Intezer, and Avast reports). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data collection, analysis, pivoting. Includes realistic queries, Sigma rules, and expert tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., CI/CD labs) to avoid prod builds. Baselines: 30-90 days of update/download logs for anomalies.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Contextualize the attackâ€”Piriform's compromised build servers tainted updates; prioritize CI/CD monitoring.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK for Axiom/APT17 (e.g., T1195 for supply chain). IOCs: Loader hashes (MD5: 6f7840c77f99049d788155c1351e1560b62b8ad18ad0e9adda8218b9f432f0a9), ShadowPad C2 (e.g., mal.com variants), targeted domains (akamai.com, sony.com). Cross-ref Cisco Talos analysis, Intezer attribution, Avast timeline, and Hacker News summary.
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory build servers (e.g., Jenkins), update endpoints (S3 mirrors), signing certs. Use tools like GitHub Advanced Security or Sonatype for supply chain; BloodHound for RDP paths.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log build jobs (no anomalies), update downloads (internal IPs), second-stage activations (none). Tool: Sysmon (build config for process/registry); enable CI/CD auditing.
- **Expert Tip**: Sign updates with hardware security modules (HSMs). Hypothesis: "APT17 breaches via RDP to inject into builds; hunt anomalous build logs leading to tainted updates."
