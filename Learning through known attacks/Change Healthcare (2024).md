### Teaching Threat Hunting for Change Healthcare Ransomware Attack-Like Attacks (2024): A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter with expertise in ransomware operations targeting critical infrastructure like healthcare, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2024 Change Healthcare ransomware incident. This was a devastating RaaS attack attributed to the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group (Russian-linked cybercriminals, per UnitedHealth Group confirmation on February 29, 2024), affecting Change Healthcare (a UnitedHealth Group subsidiary processing 15 billion claims annually, 1/3 of U.S. patient records). Attackers gained access via exploitation of vulnerabilities in ConnectWise ScreenConnect (CVE-2024-1708/1709, remote code execution flaws allowing authentication bypass), deployed ransomware on February 21, 2024, encrypting systems and causing nationwide disruptions. The attack halted claims processing, prescription fills, and payments for weeks, exfiltrating data on ~192.7 million individuals (names, addresses, DOBs, SSNs, diagnoses, PHI). BlackCat claimed responsibility on February 28, 2024, posting screenshots on their leak site. A $22M Bitcoin ransom was reportedly paid on March 1, 2024, but the group vanished in March amid internal disputes, with RansomHub claiming the data in April 2024.

Dwell time: ~4 days (access February 17-20, 2024; encryption February 21), but preparation likely months (ScreenConnect flaws known since February 19, 2024). Undetected due to unpatched vulnerabilities, inadequate third-party risk management, and no real-time monitoring. Detection: Internal tools flagged unusual activity on February 21; confirmed BlackCat by February 29. Impacts: $2.87B total cost for UnitedHealth (Q3 2024 earnings), $6.3B delayed claims (Kodiak data), 94% of hospitals affected (AHA survey), ongoing lawsuits, and HHS/OCR investigations (breach report July 19, 2024). From a MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise perspective, key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Exploitation of Public-Facing Application T1190 via CVE-2024-1708), TA0002 (Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter T1059.001), TA0003 (Persistence: Valid Accounts T1078.002), TA0005 (Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses T1562.001), TA0006 (Credential Access: OS Credential Dumping T1003), TA0008 (Lateral Movement: Exploitation of Remote Services T1210), TA0009 (Collection: Data from Information Repositories T1213), TA0010 (Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service T1567.002), and TA0040 (Impact: Data Encrypted for Impact T1486).

Threat hunting assumes breach: Hypothesis-driven searches for RMM/vulnerability exploits leading to ransomware in healthcare. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: Hybrid RMM (ConnectWise-like), unpatched servers, PHI databases.
- **Adversary Profile**: RaaS (zero-days, automated exfil; extortion via leaks).
- **Challenges**: Weekend timing, supply-chain (third-party flaws), massive PHI volume.
- **Tools/Data Sources**: EDR (CrowdStrike for behaviors), SIEM (Splunk for vuln logs), vuln scanners (Nessus for CVE-2024-1708), YARA/Sigma for BlackCat IOCs (e.g., SHA256: ransomware binaries from leaks).
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., "BlackCat exploits RMM zero-days; hunt anomalous uploads leading to encryption."

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (mapped from Mandiant, CISA, and HHS analyses). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data collection, analysis, pivoting. Includes realistic queries, Sigma rules, and expert tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., RMM labs) to avoid HIPAA risks. Baselines: 30-60 days of network/DB logs for anomalies.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Contextualize the attackâ€”BlackCat's ConnectWise exploit enabled nationwide PHI theft; prioritize third-party patching.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK for BlackCat (S1064). IOCs: CVE-2024-1708 payloads (auth bypass in ScreenConnect), BlackCat notes ("your files are encrypted"), leak site screenshots. Cross-ref HIPAA Journal timeline, TechCrunch timeline, HHS FAQ, and AHA survey.
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory RMM tools (ConnectWise), PHI DBs (SQL Server), third-party integrations. Use Nessus for CVE-2024-1708; BloodHound for paths.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log RMM updates (signed), DB queries (no dumps). Tool: Sysmon (process/network config); enable ConnectWise auditing.
- **Expert Tip**: Patch CVE-2024-1708/1709. Hypothesis: "BlackCat exploits RMM flaws; hunt anomalous auth bypasses leading to ransomware."
