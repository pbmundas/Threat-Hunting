### Teaching Threat Hunting for Sony Pictures Breach-Like Attacks (2014): A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter specializing in nation-state APTs and destructive malware campaigns, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) breach. This was a politically motivated cyber operation attributed to North Korean state-sponsored actors (Lazarus Group, per FBI analysis), targeting SPE in retaliation for the film *The Interview*, a comedy depicting the assassination of Kim Jong-un. Attackers (self-styled "Guardians of Peace" or GOP) gained initial access likely via spear-phishing or exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities, then conducted extensive reconnaissance, exfiltrated ~100TB of data (e.g., unreleased films like *Annie* and *Fury*, executive emails, 47,000 SSNs, salaries, scripts), and deployed destructive wiper malware (Shamoon-like, overwriting MBR and files with GOP imagery/skeleton screens). The attack disrupted operations (e.g., email outage for 6,600 employees), leaked data via torrent sites, and issued threats mimicking 9/11 to halt the film's release.

Dwell time: ~2-3 months (estimated September-November 2014 for infiltration/exfil; wiper executed November 24, 2014), undetected due to poor segmentation, outdated security (e.g., weak AV, no SIEM), and under-resourced IT (e.g., 2011 PwC audit flagged issues). Detection: November 24, 2014, via on-screen warnings; FBI confirmed North Korea on December 19, 2014, via malware TTPs (e.g., Korean strings, IP overlaps with prior NK ops). Impacts: $15M immediate costs, $100M+ in lawsuits/settlements, $35M SEC fine for non-disclosure, reputational damage (e.g., Amy Pascal resignation), and precedent for state-sponsored corporate attacks. From a MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise perspective, key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Phishing T1566.001, Exploit Public-Facing Application T1190), TA0003 (Persistence: Valid Accounts T1078.002), TA0005 (Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses T1562.001), TA0007 (Discovery: Account Discovery T1087), TA0006 (Credential Access: OS Credential Dumping T1003), TA0009 (Collection: Data from Information Repositories T1213), TA0010 (Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service T1567.002), TA0040 (Impact: Data Destruction T1485 via wiper), and TA0011 (Command and Control: Proxy T1090).

Threat hunting assumes breach: Hypothesis-driven searches for long-dwell APTs with destructive payloads in media/entertainment sectors. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: Flat enterprise networks (e.g., Windows AD, email servers, file shares with IP like scripts/films); high-value data (PII, IP).
- **Adversary Profile**: Nation-state (patient exfil, custom wipers; political motives, proxy use for deniability).
- **Challenges**: Massive data volumes masking exfil, weak logging (no EDR), insider-like access (e.g., admin creds).
- **Tools/Data Sources**: EDR (Carbon Black for endpoint), SIEM (Splunk/ELK for email/file logs), network metadata (Zeek for proxies), file integrity (Tripwire), YARA/Sigma for wiper IOCs (e.g., MD5: e0f5b2a0e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6 for Destover variant).
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., "An adversary has phished for creds to exfil IP and deploy wipers."

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (mapped from Operation Blockbuster by Novetta, FBI reports, and Mandiant analysis). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data collection, analysis, pivoting. Includes realistic queries, Sigma rules, and expert tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., media labs) to avoid leaks. Baselines: 60-90 days of file/email logs for anomalies.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Understand the breachâ€”Sony's flat network and poor patching enabled deep access; focus on email/IP monitoring.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK for Lazarus (e.g., T1485 for wipers). IOCs: Wiper strings ("GOD IS YOUR SAVIOR", GOP skull wallpaper), C2 IPs (e.g., NK proxies), malware hashes (SHA256: 0a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b). Cross-ref Wikipedia , Novetta's Operation Blockbuster , FBI attribution , and Krebs .
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory email gateways (Exchange), file shares (e.g., for scripts/films), AD groups (exec admins). Use BloodHound for paths from phishing users to shares; Shodan for exposed ports.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log email attachments (Event ID 2003), file accesses (4663), outbound (large torrents). Tool: Sysmon (config for process/file/network); enable file auditing on shares.
- **Expert Tip**: Scan for weak hashing (e.g., NTLMv1). Hypothesis: "Lazarus uses phishing for foothold; hunt anomalous email opens leading to exfil."

#### Step 2: Hunt for Initial Access (TA0001) - Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment/Link (T1566.001), Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)

- **Expert Tip**: ATT&CK Navigator for media; evolve for 2025 (e.g., AI wipers).
