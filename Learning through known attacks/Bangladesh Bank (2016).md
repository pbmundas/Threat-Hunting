### Teaching Threat Hunting for Bangladesh Bank Heist-Like Attacks (2016): A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter with deep expertise in financial sector APTs and SWIFT ecosystem threats, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2016 Bangladesh Bank cyber heist. This was a sophisticated financial theft operation attributed to the Lazarus Group (North Korean state-sponsored actors, per FBI and FireEye analysis), targeting the Bangladesh Bank's SWIFT messaging system. Attackers gained initial access via spear-phishing emails delivering malware (e.g., custom backdoor in ZIP files) to bank employees, then conducted extensive lateral movement to steal SWIFT credentials, map the network, and manipulate the SWIFTLIVE system. On February 4-5, 2016 (weekend timing to evade monitoring), they issued 35 fraudulent transfer requests totaling $951M to the New York Fed; five succeeded ($101M stolen, $81M laundered via RCBC in the Philippines to casinos, $20M to Sri Lanka). Malware deleted logs and spoofed printer output to delay detection. The remaining $850M was blocked due to a typo ("Shalika Fundation").

Dwell time: ~13 months (January 2015 spear-phishing to February 6, 2016 detection via printer restart), undetected due to lax email filtering, no segmentation, absent SIEM/DLP, and weekend execution. Detection: Bank staff noticed printer issues; FireEye confirmed Lazarus via TTPs (e.g., malware overlaps with Sony 2014). Impacts: $81M irrecoverable loss (only $18M recovered), $66M RCBC fallout (resignations, lawsuits), damaged global SWIFT trust (leading to Customer Security Programme, CSP), and geopolitical sanctions on North Korea. From a MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise perspective, key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Spearphishing Attachment T1566.001), TA0002 (Execution: Exploitation for Client Execution T1203), TA0003 (Persistence: Valid Accounts T1078.002), TA0005 (Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses T1562.001), TA0007 (Discovery: Account Discovery T1087), TA0008 (Lateral Movement: Valid Accounts T1078.002), TA0006 (Credential Access: OS Credential Dumping T1003), TA0009 (Collection: Data from Information Repositories T1213), TA0010 (Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service T1567.002), and TA0040 (Impact: Data Manipulation T1565.001 via SWIFT fraud).

Threat hunting assumes breach: Hypothesis-driven searches for credential theft and financial messaging manipulation in banking. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: Hybrid finance nets (e.g., Windows AD, SWIFT terminals on isolated segments, no 2FA); high-value targets (SWIFT creds).
- **Adversary Profile**: State-sponsored (low-and-slow phishing, custom malware; financial gain for regime funding, weekend ops).
- **Challenges**: SWIFT's air-gapped nature limits logging, weekend blind spots, money laundering evades AML.
- **Tools/Data Sources**: EDR (CrowdStrike for endpoints), SIEM (Splunk for SWIFT logs), network metadata (Zeek for anomalies), SWIFT CSP tools, YARA/Sigma for Lazarus IOCs (e.g., SHA256: 1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b).
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., "An adversary has phished for creds to manipulate SWIFT and launder funds."

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (mapped from FireEye's SWIFT report, U.S. DOJ indictments, and SWIFT CSP). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data collection, analysis, pivoting. Includes realistic queries, Sigma rules, and expert tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., SWIFT sim labs) to avoid regulatory issues (e.g., FFIEC compliance). Baselines: 60-90 days of transaction/email logs for anomalies.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Contextualize the heistâ€”Bangladesh's weak defenses enabled SWIFT compromise; prioritize email/SWIFT monitoring.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK for Lazarus (e.g., T1566.001 for phishing). IOCs: Malware hashes (MD5: 3e8b17d38b867f87df42321e762df34b for ZIP dropper), SWIFT typos ("foundation" misspells), laundering IOCs (RCBC accounts). Cross-ref FireEye report , FBI attribution , SWIFT CSP , and DOJ Park Jin Hyok indictment .
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory email gateways, SWIFT terminals (e.g., Alliance Access), AD groups (SWIFT admins). Use BloodHound for paths from employees to SWIFT; Nessus for unpatched systems.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log phishing opens (Event ID 2003), SWIFT messages (MT103 transfers < $10K), outbound (no casino IPs). Tool: Sysmon (config for process/registry/network); SWIFT Logger for message audits.
- **Expert Tip**: Implement SWIFT CSP controls (e.g., 2FA on terminals). Hypothesis: "Lazarus phishes for SWIFT creds; hunt anomalous email to transaction anomalies."
