### Teaching Threat Hunting for Maersk NotPetya Attack-Like Attacks (2017): A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter with deep experience in supply-chain ransomware and OT/IT hybrid threats, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2017 Maersk NotPetya incident. This was a destructive wiper campaign disguised as ransomware, attributed to Russia's Sandworm (GRU Unit 74455), starting June 27, 2017, primarily targeting Ukraine but spreading globally via a supply-chain compromise in M.E.Doc tax software updates. For Maersk (A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world's largest container shipping firm), NotPetya encrypted 45,000 endpoints and 4,000 servers across 600 sites in 130 countries, halting operations for 10 days. Manual processes (e.g., Excel on radios) resumed shipping, but the attack wiped backups, forcing full rebuilds. It used EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144, SMBv1 exploit leaked from NSA) for propagation, Mimikatz for credential dumping, and a custom wiper (Petya-like bootlocker) that overwrote the MBR and files, demanding $300 BTC (unpayable). No real ransom; goal was destruction amid Ukraine conflict.

Dwell time: ~1 day for global spread (Ukraine to Maersk within hours), but preparation ~months (Sandworm's M.E.Doc breach). Undetected due to trusted update channels, unpatched Windows (SMBv1 enabled), no EDR on OT, and rapid propagation. Detection: Maersk IT spotted encryption; Cisco Talos/ESET analyzed malware, attributing to Sandworm by July 2017. Impacts: $250-300M for Maersk (lost revenue, rebuilds), $10B global (e.g., Merck $870M, FedEx $400M), accelerated patching (MS17-010), and sanctions (U.S. Treasury on Russia). From a MITRE ATT&CK ICS/Enterprise perspective, key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Supply Chain Compromise T1195), TA0002 (Execution: Exploitation for Client Execution T1203), TA0003 (Persistence: Valid Accounts T1078.002), TA0005 (Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses T1562.001), TA0006 (Credential Access: OS Credential Dumping T1003), TA0008 (Lateral Movement: Lateral Tool Transfer T1570), TA0009 (Collection: Automated Collection T1119), TA0010 (Exfiltration: Minimal, focus on destruction), and TA0040 (Impact: Data Encrypted for Impact T1486, Inhibit Response Function T0814).

Threat hunting assumes infection: Hypothesis-driven searches for update compromises leading to wiper propagation in logistics/energy. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: IT/OT hybrid (e.g., Windows AD, unpatched SMB, supply-chain updates); global ops with flat nets.
- **Adversary Profile**: Nation-state (wiper via exploits, rapid spread; geopolitical disruption).
- **Challenges**: Trusted updates evade AV, SMB propagation, OT unmonitored.
- **Tools/Data Sources**: EDR (CrowdStrike for propagation), SIEM (Splunk for update logs), OT (Claroty for ICS), YARA/Sigma for NotPetya IOCs (e.g., SHA256: 65cee234f3ce2e3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b).
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., "An adversary has tainted updates to propagate wipers via SMB."

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (mapped from Talos/ESET reports). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data collection, analysis, pivoting. Includes realistic queries, Sigma rules, and expert tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., OT labs per NIST 800-82) to avoid disruptions. Baselines: 30-60 days of update/network logs for anomalies.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Contextualize the attackâ€”NotPetya's M.E.Doc compromise spread via EternalBlue; prioritize update/SMB monitoring.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK for NotPetya (S0368). IOCs: EternalBlue payloads (SMB \xFF SMB \x00), wiper strings ("Oops, your important files are encrypted"), C2 (e.g., sigus4.com). Cross-ref Talos analysis, Wikipedia, Wired deep dive, and Maersk case study.
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory update servers (e.g., WSUS/M.E.Doc-like), SMB shares, OT endpoints. Use Nmap for SMBv1; BloodHound for propagation paths.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log updates (trusted sources), SMB traffic (no EternalBlue), encryption spikes. Tool: Sysmon (SMB config for network/process); Wireshark for protocol.
- **Expert Tip**: Disable SMBv1. Hypothesis: "Sandworm taints updates for SMB wipers; hunt anomalous downloads leading to propagation."
