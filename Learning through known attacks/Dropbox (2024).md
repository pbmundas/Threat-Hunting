### Teaching Threat Hunting for Dropbox Sign Breach-Like Attacks (2024): A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter with expertise in supply-chain credential compromises and SaaS platform breaches, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2024 Dropbox Sign (formerly HelloSign) breach. This incident involved an unidentified threat actor compromising a service account in Dropbox Sign's production environment on April 19, 2024 (discovered April 24, 2024), accessing customer data for all users, including emails, usernames, phone numbers, hashed passwords, general account settings, and authentication information (API keys, OAuth tokens, MFA details). The breach affected Dropbox Sign's automated system configuration tool, enabling unauthorized database access. No evidence of account content (e.g., documents) being compromised, but API/OAuth theft posed risks for connected apps. Dropbox responded by rotating keys, notifying regulators (Irish DPC, SEC filing May 1, 2024), and restricting functionality. Attribution remains unclear, but it highlights supply-chain risks in SaaS (e.g., non-human identities like service accounts).

Dwell time: ~5 days (April 19-24, 2024), undetected due to weak service account security (no MFA/rotation), inadequate logging for config tools, and isolated environments. Detection: Internal monitoring flagged unusual activity; SEC Form 8-K disclosed it. Impacts: Potential cascading breaches via stolen tokens (e.g., connected SaaS like Google Workspace), regulatory scrutiny (GDPR/SEC), and eroded trust (second Dropbox incident in 2 years, following 2022 code theft). From a MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise perspective, key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Valid Accounts T1078.004 via service account compromise), TA0003 (Persistence: Valid Accounts T1078.002), TA0005 (Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses T1562.001 via weak auth), TA0006 (Credential Access: Unsecured Credentials T1552.005 for tokens), TA0007 (Discovery: Account Discovery T1087), TA0009 (Collection: Data from Information Repositories T1213), and TA0010 (Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel T1041, minimal).

Threat hunting assumes compromise: Hypothesis-driven searches for service account abuse in SaaS environments. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: SaaS platforms (e.g., Dropbox Sign with API integrations), non-human accounts (service keys).
- **Adversary Profile**: Advanced (credential stuffing or insider-like access; token theft for lateral in connected apps).
- **Challenges**: Non-human identities hard to monitor, token reuse, isolated prod envs.
- **Tools/Data Sources**: EDR (CrowdStrike for behaviors), SIEM (Splunk for API logs), IAM auditors (Okta/Dropbox API), YARA/Sigma for IOCs (e.g., anomalous token usage).
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., "An adversary compromises service accounts to access customer data; hunt anomalous API calls leading to token theft."

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (mapped from Dropbox's SEC filing, The Hacker News analysis, and Varonis report). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data collection, analysis, pivoting. Includes realistic queries, Sigma rules, and expert tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., API sandboxes) to avoid GDPR risks. Baselines: 60-90 days of API/auth logs for anomalies.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Contextualize the breachâ€”compromised service accounts enabled customer data access; prioritize non-human identity monitoring.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK for T1078.004 (non-human accounts). IOCs: Anomalous service account logons (April 19-24, 2024), API key patterns (compromised tokens). Cross-ref Dropbox SEC filing, The Hacker News disclosure, Varonis analysis, and Malwarebytes report.
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory service accounts (e.g., Dropbox Sign API keys), connected apps (OAuth scopes). Use IAM tools like Okta for non-human auditing; Splunk for API baselines.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log service logons (internal only), API calls (low-volume). Tool: Sysmon (API config for process/auth); enable Dropbox API auditing.
- **Expert Tip**: Rotate service keys quarterly. Hypothesis: "Threat actors target service accounts for data access; hunt anomalous logons leading to API abuse."

#### Step 2: Hunt for Initial Access (TA0001) - Valid Accounts (T1078.004 via Service Account)
Compromised service account in production environment.
- **Hypothesis**: "An adversary abuses non-human service accounts for entry."
- **Data Sources**: Auth logs (Event ID 4624 for service), API access logs.
- **Step-by-Step Hunting**:
  1. Query Service Logons: Splunk SPL: `index=auth EventID=4624 | search AccountName="service_account*" LogonType=5 | stats count by src_ip, geo | where geo!="internal" OR count > baseline`.
  2. Sigma Rule (YAML):
     ```
     title: Service Account Abuse
     logsource:
       category: authentication
     detection:
       selection:

     ```
  3. Monitor: Token abuse.
  4. Pivoting: Alerts.
- **Expert Tip**: Token monitoring. Realistic: API risks; hunt connected.

#### Step 13: Post-Hunt - Response, Remediation, and Iteration
- **If Found**: Contain (rotate keys, isolate services), eradicate (audit accounts, scan), recover (notify DPC, restrict APIs). Like Dropbox, rotate tokens; engage regulators.
- **Lessons**: Per SEC filing, secure service accounts, audit APIs, notify promptly. Iterate monthly; simulate with token theft.
- **Expert Tip**: ATT&CK for SaaS; evolve for 2025 (e.g., AI token anomalies).
