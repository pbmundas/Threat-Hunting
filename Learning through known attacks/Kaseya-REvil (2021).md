### Teaching Threat Hunting for Kaseya-REvil Attack-Like Attacks (2021): A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter specializing in ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) supply-chain compromises and managed service provider (MSP) ecosystems, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2021 Kaseya-REvil ransomware attack. This was a high-impact RaaS operation by the REvil (aka Sodinokibi) group (Russian-linked cybercriminals, per FBI and Europol attribution), exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Kaseya's Virtual System Administrator (VSA) remote monitoring and management (RMM) software. On July 2, 2021 (U.S. Independence Day weekend, minimizing response), REvil breached Kaseya VSA servers via CVE-2021-30116 (path traversal and arbitrary file upload, CVSS 9.8), deploying a malicious "agent hotfix" that propagated REvil ransomware to ~1,500 downstream businesses across 17 countries (via 30-60 MSPs using VSA). The attack encrypted files, deleted shadow copies, and demanded $70M in Bitcoin for a universal decryptor (unpaid; Kaseya obtained a key from a "trusted third party" on July 23). Affected entities included U.S. grocery chains (e.g., Coop Sverige, closing 800 stores), New Zealand schools, and global firms, causing widespread outages.

Dwell time: ~3 months (April 2021 DIVD disclosure of VSA flaws to Kaseya; attack execution July 2), with rapid propagation (~hours post-breach). Undetected due to zero-days, weekend timing, and no immediate patching (despite DIVD warnings). Detection: Kaseya detected unusual VSA activity on July 2; confirmed REvil by July 3 via IOCs (e.g., BlackLivesMatter mutex). Impacts: $70M ransom demand (highest ever), $18.5M+ in losses for affected MSPs, global supply-chain disruption, REvil site takedown (July 13, U.S./Russia action), and arrests (e.g., Yaroslav Vasinskyi, 22, sentenced 2022). From a MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise perspective, key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Exploitation of Public-Facing Application T1190 via CVE-2021-30116), TA0002 (Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter T1059.001 via PowerShell), TA0003 (Persistence: Valid Accounts T1078.002), TA0005 (Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses T1562.001 via log deletion), TA0006 (Credential Access: OS Credential Dumping T1003), TA0008 (Lateral Movement: Exploitation of Remote Services T1210), TA0009 (Collection: Automated Collection T1119), TA0010 (Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service T1567.002, minimal), and TA0040 (Impact: Data Encrypted for Impact T1486).

Threat hunting assumes breach: Hypothesis-driven searches for zero-day exploits in RMM tools leading to ransomware propagation in MSP ecosystems. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: MSP-managed networks (VSA on-premises/cloud, Windows AD); high-trust updates.
- **Adversary Profile**: RaaS affiliates (zero-days, automated deployment; extortion via leaks).
- **Challenges**: Weekend attacks, supply-chain trust, rapid encryption.
- **Tools/Data Sources**: EDR (CrowdStrike for behaviors), SIEM (Splunk for VSA logs), vuln scanners (Nessus for CVE-2021-30116), YARA/Sigma for REvil IOCs (e.g., SHA256: 6f7840c77f99049d788155c1351e1560b62b8ad18ad0e9adda8218b9f432f0a9 for mpsvc.dll).
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., "REvil exploits VSA zero-days to deploy ransomware; hunt anomalous hotfixes leading to encryption."

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (mapped from ESET, Truesec, and Splunk analyses). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data collection, analysis, pivoting. Includes realistic queries, Sigma rules, and expert tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., VSA labs) to avoid MSP disruptions. Baselines: 30-60 days of update/network logs for anomalies.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Contextualize the attackâ€”REvil's VSA zero-day enabled MSP-wide propagation; prioritize RMM monitoring.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK for REvil (S0496). IOCs: CVE-2021-30116 payloads (SQL injection in /agentRemove/upload), REvil mutex (BlackLivesMatter), DLL side-loading (MsMpEng.exe loads mpsvc.dll). Cross-ref ESET analysis , Truesec timeline , Splunk MITRE mapping , and CISA guidance .
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory VSA servers (on-prem/cloud), MSP clients, AD paths. Use Nessus for CVE-2021-30116; BloodHound for propagation.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log VSA updates (signed), agent deployments (no encryption). Tool: Sysmon (process/network config); enable VSA auditing.
- **Expert Tip**: Patch CVE-2021-30116 immediately. Hypothesis: "REvil exploits VSA zero-days; hunt anomalous uploads leading to ransomware."
