### Teaching Threat Hunting for Ukrainian Power Grid Attack-Like Attacks (2015): A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter with specialized experience in ICS/OT-targeted nation-state operations, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2015 Ukrainian power grid cyberattack. This was a landmark state-sponsored operation attributed to Russian military intelligence (GRU Unit 74455, aka Sandworm or Electrum), targeting Ukraine's energy sector amid geopolitical tensions. On December 23, 2015, attackers compromised three regional electric power distribution companies (Prykarpattyaoblenergo, Kyivoblenergo, and others under Ukrenergo), using spear-phishing for initial access, BlackEnergy malware for command-and-control (C2), and custom tools to manipulate ICS protocols (e.g., Modbus/IP and IEC 60870-5-104). They remotely opened circuit breakers, causing outages for ~230,000 customers lasting 1-6 hours, while deploying KillDisk wiper malware to erase evidence and disrupt recovery. This was the first confirmed cyberattack to successfully disrupt electric power grid operations via ICS manipulation.

Dwell time: ~2-3 months (initial compromise via phishing in summer/fall 2015; active manipulation on December 23), undetected due to poor IT/OT segmentation, limited logging in substations, and reliance on legacy systems (e.g., Windows XP in HMI/SCADA). Detection: Operators noticed manual breaker opens (not automated), triggering forensic analysis by Dragos and ESET; attribution confirmed by U.S. DHS/FBI in January 2016 via malware IOCs and TTP overlaps with prior Russian ops (e.g., 2014 Crimea blackout). Impacts: Temporary blackouts (no long-term damage), $10M+ economic loss, heightened global CI alerts (e.g., ICS-CERT advisories), and precedent for hybrid warfare (cyber-physical disruption). From a MITRE ATT&CK for ICS perspective, key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Spearphishing T1566.001), TA0002 (Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter T1059.001), TA0003 (Persistence: Valid Accounts T1078.002), TA0007 (Discovery: Network Service Scanning T1046), TA0008 (Lateral Movement: Exploitation of Remote Services T1210), TA0005 (Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses T1562.001), TA0009 (Collection: Data from Information Repositories T1213), TA0010 (Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service T1567.002), TA0040 (Impact: Inhibit Response Function T0814, Block Command Message T0804, Denial of Service T0814), and TA0109 (Block Command Message).

Threat hunting assumes breach: Hypothesis-driven searches for IT-to-OT pivots in energy CI. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: IT/OT hybrid (e.g., Windows AD for corporate, air-gapped SCADA/HMI with OPC/Modbus; Purdue Model Levels 0-3 violations).
- **Adversary Profile**: Nation-state (spear-phishing for creds, modular malware like BlackEnergy; hybrid warfare goals, low noise via proxies).
- **Challenges**: Sparse OT logging (PLCs don't log well), legacy systems (unpatchable), manual ops masking anomalies.
- **Tools/Data Sources**: EDR (Dragos/Claroty for OT), SIEM (Splunk/ELK for IT/OT fusion), protocol analyzers (Wireshark for Modbus), YARA/Sigma for BlackEnergy IOCs (e.g., SHA256: 3e1e4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f), CISA alerts.
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., "An adversary has phished for IT creds to scan and manipulate OT protocols."

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (mapped from Dragos' CRASHOVERRIDE report, ESET analysis, and ICS-CERT IR). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data collection, analysis, pivoting. Includes realistic queries, Sigma rules, and expert tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., ICS labs per NIST SP 800-82) to avoid disruptions. Baselines: 30-90 days of IT/OT logs for anomalies.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Contextualize the attackâ€”Ukraine's attackers bridged IT/OT via weak segmentation; prioritize protocol monitoring.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK ICS for Sandworm (e.g., T0814 for breaker control). IOCs: BlackEnergy C2 domains (e.g., mal.com), KillDisk hashes (MD5: 6a4b5c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d), Modbus payloads (e.g., coil writes to address 0x0001). Cross-ref Dragos report , ESET analysis , ICS-CERT IR , and CISA alerts .
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory IT assets (AD/VPN), OT (HMI/SCADA servers, PLCs via Modbus), boundaries (firewalls). Use BloodHound for AD-to-OT paths; OT tools like Nozomi for protocol baselines.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log phishing opens (Event ID 2003), OT traffic (Modbus reads only, no writes), outbound (low-volume). Tool: Sysmon (OT config for network/process); Wireshark for ICS dissectors.
- **Expert Tip**: Fuse IT/OT logs via Purview. Hypothesis: "State actors phish IT for OT recon; hunt anomalous protocol traffic from corporate segments."
