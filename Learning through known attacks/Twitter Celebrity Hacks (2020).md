### Teaching Threat Hunting for the 2020 Twitter Celebrity Hacks: A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter with expertise in social engineering and platform-specific compromises, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2020 Twitter celebrity hacks. This incident, occurring on July 15, 2020, was a coordinated social engineering attack by a group of teenagers led by 17-year-old Graham Ivan Clark (aka "Lil' Man") from Florida, along with accomplices Mason Sheppard (19, U.K., aka "Chaewon") and Nima Fazeli (22, Florida, aka "Rolex"). They targeted Twitter's internal tools, gaining access via vishing (voice phishing) to trick employees into providing credentials. Over ~1 hour, they hijacked 130+ high-profile accounts, including those of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian West, Apple, Uber, and crypto firms, posting a Bitcoin scam promising to double donations (netting ~$120,000). They also sold access to desirable usernames on hacker forums. The attack exposed Twitter's internal vulnerabilities, leading to temporary lockdown of verified accounts. Clark was sentenced to 3 years in prison (2021); Sheppard and Fazeli faced charges.

Dwell time: Minimal for execution (~1 hour), but preparation involved weeks (forum reconnaissance, tool access). Undetected due to weak employee verification, no multi-layered auth for internal tools, and rapid execution. Detection: Twitter's security team noticed unusual activity; full scope revealed via FBI investigation. Impacts: $120K stolen, eroded trust in Twitter (stock dip), DOJ indictments (July 31, 2020), and platform reforms (e.g., enhanced employee training). From a MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise perspective, key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Valid Accounts T1078.002 via social engineering), TA0002 (Execution: User Execution T1204.002), TA0005 (Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses T1562.004 via tool abuse), TA0007 (Discovery: Account Discovery T1087), TA0008 (Lateral Movement: Valid Accounts T1078.002), TA0009 (Collection: Data from Information Repositories T1213), and TA0010 (Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel T1041, minimal).

Threat hunting assumes breach: Hypothesis-driven searches for social engineering leading to internal tool abuse in social media platforms. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: Internal admin tools (e.g., Twitter's account support panel), AD-integrated access; high-value verified accounts.
- **Adversary Profile**: Young cybercriminals (vishing for creds, rapid hijacks; financial scams via Bitcoin).
- **Challenges**: Human-targeted (bypasses tech), quick execution, forum sales for persistence.
- **Tools/Data Sources**: SIEM (Splunk for auth/help desk logs), EDR (CrowdStrike for behaviors), vishing sims (GoPhish), YARA/Sigma for IOCs (e.g., Bitcoin wallet addresses from scam tweets).
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., "Teen hackers vish employees for tool access; hunt anomalous internal logons leading to account hijacks."

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (mapped from DOJ indictments, Twitter's report, and Krebs analysis). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data collection, analysis, pivoting. Includes realistic queries, Sigma rules, and expert tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., internal tool sims) to avoid platform risks. Baselines: 30-60 days of auth/internal logs for anomalies.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Contextualize the hackâ€”attackers vished Twitter employees for internal tool access; prioritize help desk monitoring.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK for T1078 (e.g., social engineering). IOCs: Vishing scripts (e.g., impersonating IT), Bitcoin wallets (e.g., 16PWaZ1Q1Z1Z1Z1Z1Z1Z1Z1Z1Z1Z1Z1Z1Z from scam tweets), forum sales (OGUsers). Cross-ref Wikipedia timeline, Al Jazeera charges, Guardian arrests, and NPR indictments.
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory internal tools (e.g., Twitter's account panel), help desk (ServiceNow), AD groups (tool admins). Use BloodHound for paths from employees to tools; sim vishing with tools like GoPhish.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log employee vish calls (verified only), tool logons (internal IPs). Tool: Sysmon (auth config for process/logons); enable help desk auditing.
- **Expert Tip**: Train on vishing. Hypothesis: "Hackers vish employees for tool creds; hunt anomalous help desk calls leading to hijacks."

#### Step 2: Hunt for Initial Access (TA0001) - Valid Accounts (T1078.002 via Social Engineering)
