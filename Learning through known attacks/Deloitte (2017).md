### Teaching Threat Hunting for Deloitte Breach-Like Attacks (2017): A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter specializing in professional services and cloud-adjacent compromises, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2017 Deloitte data breach. This incident involved unauthorized access to Deloitte's global email platform, likely by nation-state or advanced cybercriminals (attribution unclear, but suspected state-sponsored due to targeted client data). Attackers compromised an admin account without multi-factor authentication (MFA), accessing the entire email database for months (discovered March 2017, but access possibly from late 2016). Stolen data included confidential emails, usernames, passwords, IP addresses, business plans, architectural diagrams, health information, intellectual property, product specifications, manufacturing techniques, and PII from up to 350 clients (e.g., FIFA, global banks, airlines, car manufacturers, energy firms, pharma, and U.S. government entities). The breach affected all company email and admin accounts, but Deloitte downplayed it as impacting "very few" clients. No malware details publicized; focus was on credential compromise and data exfiltration.

Dwell time: ~6-9 months (late 2016 to March 2017 detection via internal review), undetected due to no MFA on admin accounts, poor logging, and delayed investigation. Detection: Internal audit in March 2017; disclosed September 2017 after Guardian reporting. Impacts: Embarrassment for Deloitte (world's top cybersecurity consultant), FTC/SEC scrutiny (part of broader non-disclosure issues), client notifications (only 6 admitted, but sources claim 350), and enhanced email security mandates. From a MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise perspective, key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Valid Accounts T1078.002), TA0005 (Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses T1562.001 via weak auth), TA0007 (Discovery: Account Discovery T1087), TA0006 (Credential Access: Unsecured Credentials T1552.001), TA0009 (Collection: Data from Information Repositories T1213), TA0010 (Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service T1567.002), and TA0003 (Persistence: Valid Accounts T1078).

Threat hunting assumes compromise: Hypothesis-driven searches for admin credential abuse in email systems for professional services firms. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: Enterprise email platforms (e.g., Exchange/Office 365), AD-integrated admin accounts; high-value client data in emails.
- **Adversary Profile**: Advanced (credential stuffing or phishing for admins; targeted exfil of client intel, low noise).
- **Challenges**: Email volume masks anomalies, no MFA on legacy admins, delayed disclosure risks.
- **Tools/Data Sources**: EDR (Microsoft Defender for email), SIEM (Splunk for auth/email logs), email security (Proofpoint), YARA/Sigma for IOCs (e.g., anomalous admin logons).
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., "An adversary has compromised admin creds to access client emails."

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (inferred from Guardian reporting, Krebs analysis, and Deloitte statements). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data collection, analysis, pivoting. Includes realistic queries, Sigma rules, and expert tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., email labs) to avoid compliance issues (e.g., GDPR). Baselines: 60-90 days of email/auth logs for anomalies.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Contextualize the breachâ€”Deloitte's weak admin auth enabled email access; prioritize MFA and logging.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK for credential abuse (e.g., T1078 for admins). IOCs: Anomalous admin logons (e.g., non-U.S. IPs), client email patterns (e.g., FIFA/banks). Cross-ref Guardian reporting, Krebs analysis, BBC coverage, and Deloitte factsheet.
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory email admins (Exchange/AD), client inboxes (shared folders). Use BloodHound for paths from admins to client data; Microsoft Purview for email auditing.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log admin logons (Event ID 4624, internal only), email searches (low-volume on client folders). Tool: Sysmon (email config for process/auth); enable O365 Audit Logs.
- **Expert Tip**: Audit admin accounts quarterly. Hypothesis: "Attackers target weak admin creds for email access; hunt anomalous logons leading to client data exfil."

#### Step 2: Hunt for Initial Access (TA0001) - Valid Accounts (T1078.002)
Compromised admin account without MFA.
- **Hypothesis**: "An adversary has abused weak admin credentials for email access."
- **Data Sources**: Auth logs (Event ID 4624/4771), O365 sign-ins (failed successes).
