### Teaching Threat Hunting for Synnovis-NHS Ransomware Attack-Like Attacks (2024): A Pro Threat Hunter's Step-by-Step Guide

As a professional threat hunter specializing in ransomware operations targeting critical healthcare infrastructure, I'll guide you through proactive threat hunting to detect attacks resembling the 2024 Synnovis-NHS ransomware incident. This was a severe attack by the Qilin ransomware group (Russian-linked cybercriminals, per NCSC attribution), targeting Synnovis, a pathology services provider for NHS trusts in south east London. On June 3, 2024, Qilin deployed ransomware, encrypting systems and disrupting blood testing, transfusions, and diagnostics across major hospitals (e.g., Guy’s and St Thomas’, King’s College). Attackers exfiltrated ~400GB of patient data (names, NHS numbers, test codes) after initial access in late May 2024, likely via phishing or an unpatched third-party vulnerability. Data was leaked on June 20, 2024, after ransom refusal. The attack caused 10,152 postponed appointments, 1,710 delayed procedures, two cases of severe patient harm, and £32.7M in losses.

Dwell time: ~1 month (late May to June 3, 2024), undetected due to weak endpoint security, no MFA, poor OT segmentation, and inadequate third-party risk management. Detection: Synnovis IT flagged outages on June 3; NCSC confirmed Qilin by June 24. Impacts: Major operational disruptions, regulatory scrutiny (ICO/GDPR), patient harm, and ongoing system rebuilds (full recovery by early 2025). From a MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise perspective, key tactics include TA0001 (Initial Access: Phishing T1566.001 or Exploit Public-Facing Application T1190), TA0002 (Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter T1059.001), TA0003 (Persistence: Valid Accounts T1078.002), TA0005 (Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses T1562.001), TA0006 (Credential Access: OS Credential Dumping T1003), TA0007 (Discovery: Network Service Discovery T1046), TA0008 (Lateral Movement: Exploitation of Remote Services T1210), TA0009 (Collection: Data from Information Repositories T1213), TA0010 (Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service T1567.002), and TA0040 (Impact: Data Encrypted for Impact T1486).

Threat hunting assumes breach: Hypothesis-driven searches for phishing or vuln exploits leading to ransomware in healthcare OT environments. Realistic parameters:
- **Environment**: Pathology OT (Synnovis LIMS), unpatched third-party apps, AD-integrated networks.
- **Adversary Profile**: RaaS (Qilin: phishing/vulns, automated exfil; extortion via leaks).
- **Challenges**: Legacy OT, no real-time monitoring, high PHI volume.
- **Tools/Data Sources**: EDR (CrowdStrike for behaviors), SIEM (Splunk for auth/OT logs), vuln scanners (Nessus for third-party), YARA/Sigma for Qilin IOCs (e.g., ransomware notes, C2 domains).
- **Hypotheses**: E.g., “Qilin uses phishing or third-party vulns to deploy ransomware; hunt anomalous logons leading to encryption.”

This guide covers **each relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique** (mapped from NCSC, NHS, and Synnovis reports). Proceed tactic-by-tactic with sub-steps: hypothesis, data collection, analysis, pivoting. Includes realistic queries, Sigma rules, and expert tips. Hunt in scoped envs (e.g., OT labs) to avoid HIPAA/GDPR risks. Baselines: 30-60 days of auth/OT logs for anomalies.

#### Step 1: Preparation - Intelligence Gathering and Environment Mapping
Contextualize the attack—Qilin’s phishing or vuln exploit disrupted NHS pathology; prioritize OT and third-party security.
- **Gather Threat Intel**: Review MITRE ATT&CK for Qilin. IOCs: Phishing emails (malicious links/attachments), Qilin ransom notes, C2 domains (e.g., qilin[.]onion), leaked data patterns. Cross-ref NHS statement, NCSC advisory, Synnovis updates, and BleepingComputer timeline.
- **Map Your Environment**: Inventory OT systems (e.g., Synnovis LIMS), third-party apps (e.g., pathology software), AD accounts. Use Nessus for vuln scans; BloodHound for lateral paths.
- **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Log email interactions (no malicious links), OT operations (no encryption), third-party updates. Tool: Sysmon (process/network config); enable LIMS auditing.
- **Expert Tip**: Deploy MFA for OT; audit third-party patches. Hypothesis: “Qilin exploits phishing or vulns; hunt anomalous emails or uploads leading to ransomware.”
